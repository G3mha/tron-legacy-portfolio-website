            <p>
                Since 2020, I've decided to pursue a career in tech.
                One year later, I got accepted in Computer Engineer at Insper. 
                As an undergrad student, I went deep into the rabbit hole, working
                in many projects in college, such as
                a robot that can help rescuing people in dangerous areas (such as earthquakes),
                a neural network that can drive a mini-car autonomously, 
                a videogame that is a homage to the classic movie "Night of the Living Dead",
                and a lot more.
    
                Despite the thematical diversity of my projects, they all shared something in common,
                which is the fact that they all had the purpose of making people's lives easier, through
                entertainment or solving real-world problems. That is my goal as a developer, 
                to make people's lives easier using technology as a mean.
    
                If you want to find me while I'm not coding, I may be re-watching Blade Runner, 
                scoring some goals at the soccer court, or in some wild adventure catching Pokémon.

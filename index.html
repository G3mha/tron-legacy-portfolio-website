            <p>
                Since 2020, I've decided to pursue a career in tech.
                One year later, I got accepted in Computer Engineer at Insper. 
                As an undergrad student, I went deep into the rabbit hole, working
                in many projects in college, such as
                a robot that can help rescuing people in dangerous areas (such as earthquakes),
                a neural network that can drive a mini-car autonomously, 
                a videogame that is a homage to the classic movie "Night of the Living Dead",
                and a lot more.
    
                Despite the thematical diversity of my projects, they all shared something in common,
                which is the fact that they all had the purpose of making people's lives easier, being through
                entertainment or through solving real-world problems. That is my goal as a developer, 
                to make people's lives easier using technology as a mean for that.
    
                If you want to find me while I'm not coding, you should probably check at the movies, 
                maybe in the soccer court at park, or in front of the TV, while playing some good old videogames.

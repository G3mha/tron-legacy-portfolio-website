      description: "I assisted the lead Robotics professor at Insper in creating additional exercises and activities, as well as conducted weekly tutoring sessions for students with questions about the taught content. I also developed automated tests for all course exercises using Python and Pytest. The curriculum also included extensive knowledge of ROS (Robot Operating System) and OpenCV (Computer Vision library for Python). In recognition to my efforts, I received over 23 exceptional feedback evaluations from my students, and this job with automated testing will spare the teachers hundreds of hours in subsequent classes.",

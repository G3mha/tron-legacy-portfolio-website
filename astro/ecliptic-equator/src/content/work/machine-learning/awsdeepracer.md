## Project Overview

AWS DeepRacer is a 1/18th scale autonomous racing car platform that provides a practical way to learn reinforcement learning. The challenge was to develop a model that could navigate complex racing tracks at relatively high speeds, achieving competitive lap times.

#### Technical Implementation

##### Reward Function Engineering

- Designed a sophisticated reward function incorporating multiple parameters:
  - Track position and centerline deviation
  - Steering angle and stability metrics
  - Speed optimization based on track segments
  - Progress tracking and completion incentives
- Implemented dynamic rewards scaling based on racing conditions

##### Hyperparameter Optimization

- Fine-tuned critical parameters including:
  - Learning rate: Optimized for convergence speed
  - Entropy and discount factor
  - Neural network architecture
  - Action space granularity
- Developed all-new method to assess model performance

##### Training Infrastructure

- Using AWS SageMaker for distributed training
- Implemented parallel training pipelines for faster iteration
- Created automated evaluation scripts for performance tracking
- Optimized compute resource utilization to reduce costs

#### Results & Impact

- Achieved ranking in top 0.25% globally (13th out of 5,200+ submissions), receiving recognition from AWS
- Reduced training costs by 40% through efficient resource management (first vs. final model)

#### Technical Stack

- AWS Services:
  - DeepRacer Console
  - SageMaker
  - RoboMaker

- Languages & Frameworks:
  - Python
  - TensorFlow
  - Pandas for data analysis

#### Key Learnings

- Deep understanding of reinforcement learning principles
- Practical experience with hyperparameter tuning
- Efficient cloud resource management
- Algorithm optimization, for smart decision-making

## Project Overview

Our team developed an autonomous robot for the Rescue Rapidly Manufactured Robot Challenge (RMRC) category at RoboCup 2022. The robot's primary functions include:

- Pre-deployment site inspection in disaster zones
- Real-time environmental hazard detection
- Survivor location under debris
- Creation of safe navigation paths for human rescue teams
- Remote operation in areas too dangerous for immediate human access

The robot was designed and manufactured entirely from scratch by our four-person team, focusing on durability and sensor reliability in extreme conditions.

#### Technical Implementation

The robot was developed using:
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- OpenCV for computer vision
- C++ for core functionality
- Custom sensor array for environmental monitoring

#### Key Achievements

- Awarded "Best in Class: Sensing" for excellence in:
 - Heat monitoring
 - Movement detection
 - Gas detection
 - Sound recognition
 - Hazard signal identification

- Placed 4th out of 8 international teams at RoboCup 2022 in Bangkok, Thailand

#### Impact

This project marked a significant milestone for Insper's robotics program, being one of the first Brazilian teams to compete in the RMRC category at RoboCup. The achievement helped establish Insper Dynamics as a distinct group within the university's engineering department, and secured an annual budget of $40,000 for future robotics projects.

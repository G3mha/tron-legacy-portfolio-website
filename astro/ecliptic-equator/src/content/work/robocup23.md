## Project Overview

Complete redesign of our search and rescue robot for RoboCup 2023's RMRC category, introducing autonomous navigation capabilities:

- LiDAR-based 2D environment mapping
- Semi-autonomous operation in disaster simulation zones
- Enhanced sensor array for hazard detection
- Improved mobility in debris-filled areas, including stair climbing

#### Technical Implementation

Advanced features also include:

- Reliable driving algorithm, based on the 2D generated map
- All-new ROS implementation
- Improved sensors for more precise hazard detection
- Custom-built metal chassis for durability

#### Key Achievements

- Awarded "Best in Class: Mapping" for:
 - First-ever 2D environment mapping in RMRC
 - Semi-autonomous navigation capabilities
 - Real-time map generation

- Placed 4th out of 11 international teams at RoboCup 2023 in Bordeaux, France

#### Impact

This iteration marked several milestones:

- Creation of a new award category (Best in Class: Mapping) at RoboCup
- Enhanced Insper's standing in the RoboCup community
- Generated academic opportunities:
  - National robotics competition invitations
  - Master's program scholarships for team members
